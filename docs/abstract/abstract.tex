\begin{abstract}
5 Corners is a system for organizing the operations in a graphical
application.  The commands are accessible without using a traditional menu,
but rather by clicking in the corners of a window which traps the cursor.
Using the corners is expected to be fundamentally faster, because it does not
involve positioning the cursor over a target: a corner can be reached in
constant time by pushing the mouse in the correct direction.  It will be
implemented using the FLTK GUI library and will support configurable keyboard
shortcuts.  A simple text editor will be included as an example.
